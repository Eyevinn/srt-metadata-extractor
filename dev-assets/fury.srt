00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:36,814
will be transported by an armed motorcade
through the Caucasus mountain range.

00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:40,819

destination, Ramsey is as good as gone.

ROMAN: So let me get this straight.

489
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:46,778
There's only one road that leads in or out,
sheer drops on every side,

490
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:51,095
a motorcade from hell protected by a small
army from one mile in either direction?

491
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,732
Yeah, that's about it.

492

- You done?
- No, I am not done.

493
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,314
So you all wanted me to break into
a police station. Fine.

494
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:01,940
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

495
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,854
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

496
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:09,617
Then you came up with this brilliant idea
to shoot down one of the largest airplanes ever.

497
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:13,771
I shot that shit out of the sky.
Mmm. It's nothing.

498
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,135
But this right here, my friend,

499
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:20,438
happens to be the stupidest idea
I have ever heard of in my life.

500
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:22,908
I forgot that you were the only
one to bring the plane down.

No, no. The only thing I have ever seen him
take down was "No Knees" Denise.

everybody around me making all the decisions.

506
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,140
This time, I lead.

507
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,453
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I am out.

508
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,294
All right, Roman.

509
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,016
What do you got?

510
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,895
I mean, I wasn't trying to get into
the whole leadership thing, like, now.

511
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:56,238
You know what I am saying? I was just,
kind of, talking about, like, at some point.

512
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:59,699
Like, you know, when we...
Whatever. I mean, I think...

513
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,736
Let's hit it from here.

514

- I don't think that that's...
- No, no, no, don't think.

It is impossible to hit it there.

518
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:18,999
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain. Why?

519
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,256
Because you cannot physically access it.

520
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,578
See, that's what makes it so sweet.

521
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,256
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

he's onto something there.
