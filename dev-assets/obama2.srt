My presence on this stage

16
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Is pretty unlikely

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
My father was a foreign student

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
Born and raised

19
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
In a small village

20
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
We grew up herding goats

00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
Just so many who have come before

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,840
Not studying here

36
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888

And later moved West

00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,312
All the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
M82 had Big Dreams for their daughter

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
A common dream born of two continents

55
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
My parents shared not only an improbable love

56
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,928
They shared an Abiding Faith in the possibilities of this nation

57
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
It would give me an African name

58
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Or blessed

59
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
Believing that in a tolerant America

60
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Your name is no barrier to success

61
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
They imagine they imagine me going to the best school

62
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,456
Eminem even though they weren't Rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,856
They're both passed away.

65
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
And yet I know that on this night

66
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976

67
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512

They stayed here

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
And I stand here today

70
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
Grateful for the diversity of my heritage

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Aware that my parents Dreams live on in my two precious daughters

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
I stand here knowing

73
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
The my story is part of the larger American story that

74
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,040
I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on Earth

75
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832

We Gather to affirm

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
The greatness of our nation

79
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,007
Not because of the height of are skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy

80
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
Our pride is based on a very simple plan

81
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,431
Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago

82
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
We hold these truths

83
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
All men are created

84
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,695
That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable right

85
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
That among these are life

86
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Liberty and the pursuit of happiness

87
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Is the true genius

88
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Of America

89
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,495
A fade effect and simple drinks

90
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
Unassisted on small miracle

91
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
That we can talk in our children at night

92
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,991
And know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm

93
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
So we can say what we think right what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door

94
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
That we can have an idea and start own business

95
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Without paying a price

96
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
That we can participate in the political process

97
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Without fear of Retribution

98
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
M&R boats will be counted

99
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
At least most of the time

100
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,199
This year in this election

101
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
We are called

102
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807

103
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087

And a promise of future Generations

107
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255

More work to do

113
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
For the workers that made in Galesburg Illinois

114
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
We're losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico

115
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
And now we're having to compete with their own children

116
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
4 jobs that pay 7 Bucks an hour

117
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
More to do for the father that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay for

118
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
$4,500 a month

119
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
For the drugs and Sun needs

120
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
The health benefits to be counted on

121
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
More to do for the young woman in East st. Louis

122
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
And thousands more like her

123
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Where's the graves

125
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
To go to college

126
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
Now don't get me wrong

127
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,991
The people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners

128
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
And office parks

129
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
They don't expect government to solve all their problems

130
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
They know they have to work hard to get ahead

131
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
And they want to

132
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
Going to the collar counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money Wasted by welfare agency

00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,543
Go and go into any inner city neighborhood

135
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
And folks will tell you

136
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
The government alone

137
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Did teach our kids to learn

138
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
They know the parents have to teach

139
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
The children can achieve unless we raise their

140
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
And turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is that

141
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
I know those things

142
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,751
People don't expect people don't expect government to solve all their problems

143
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
But they sent

144
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Deep in their bones

145
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,735
It would just a slight change in priorities we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at like

146
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
And if the doors of opportunity remain open to all

147
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855

We offer that choice

151
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303

The first stop

00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
You know

183
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
A while back

I was heading to work the following week

189
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
And as I listened to him explain

190
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Why he didn't list

191
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,351
The absolute Faith he had in our country and its leaders

192
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
His Devotion to duty and service I thought

193
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
This young man was all that any of us might

194
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Ever hope for in a trap

195
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
But then I ask myself

196
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Are we serving

197
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Seamus as well as he's serving us

198
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
I thought of the 900

199
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Men and women

200
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
Sons and Daughters husbands and wives

201
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Friends and Neighbors

202
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
Who won't be returning to their own hometowns

203
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,559
I thought of the family as I've met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income

204
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
Whose loved ones have returned with a luminous

205
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Order of shatter

206
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
But still

207
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Black long-term health benefits

208
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Because they were reservists

209
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,383
When we send our young men and women into Harm's Way

210
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
We have a solemn obligation

211
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
Not to fudge the numbers or save the truth about why they are going to care for their families while they're gone

212
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
10 to the soldiers upon their return at the never ever go to war without enough troops

213
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Who won the war secure the peace and earned the respect of the world

214
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,383
Now let me be clear

215
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Let me be clear

216
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
We have real enemies in the world

217
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
These enemies must be found

218
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
They must be pursued

219
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
And they must be defeated

220
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
John Kerry knows this

221
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
And just as lieutenant

222
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
Jerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men

223
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,143
Who served with him in Vietnam President Carrie will not hesitate one moment

224
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,471
To use our military might to keep America safe and secure

225
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
John Terry believe

226
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
In America

227
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Eddie knows that it's not enough

228
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
For just some of us

229
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Alongside our famous individualism

230
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
There's another ingredient

231
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
In the American Saga

232
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
A belief that we're all connected as one piece

233
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
If there's a child on the southside of Chicago who can't read

234
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
That matters to me even if

235
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for the prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine in the rent

236
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Summit 4x4 even if it's not my grandparents

237
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
If there's an Arab American family being rounded up

238
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties

239
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Videos of fundamental beliefs

240
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
It is a fundamental belief I am My Brother's Keeper

241
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,727
I am My Sister's Keeper that makes this country work

242
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:03,103
That's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams

243
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,687
And yet still come together as one American family

244
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
E pluribus unum

245
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Out of many

246
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
One

247
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Now even as we speak

248
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
There are those who are preparing

249
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
The Divide

250
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
The Spin Master

251
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
The negative ad Peddlers

252
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Embrace the politics

253
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Anything Goes

254
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Well

255
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
I say to them tonight

256
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,799
There is not a liberal America and a conservative America there is the United States

257
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
Of America there is not a Black America and a white America

258
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
Latino America and Asian America United States of America

259
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
Indian

260
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
Indian Indian that's what this election is about

261
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
Do we participate

262
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
Enter politics of cynicism

263
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
Or do we participate in a politics of Hope

264
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
John Kerry calls on us to Hope

265
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
John Edwards calls on us to Hope

266
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
I'm not talking about blind optimism here

267
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
The almost willful ignorance

268
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
The things unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it

269
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:27,071
Or Healthcare crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about

270
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Something more substantial

271
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
The hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom

272
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
The hope of immigrants setting out for dip

273
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Distant Shores

274
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
The hope of a young Naval lieutenant

275
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta

276
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
The hope of a mill worker son

277
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
Who dares to defy the odds

278
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too

279
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
Who helped in the face of difficulty

280
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
Hope in the face of uncertainty The Audacity Of Hope

281
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
What is God's greatest gift to us

282
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
The Bedrock of this nation

283
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
I believe

284
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
In Things Not Seen

285
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
I believe that there better days ahead

286
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
I believe that we can give our middle class

287
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,511
Relief and provide Working Families with a road opportunity

288
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless

289
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,959
Homes for the homeless and reclaim young people in cities Across America from violence and despair

290
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
I believe

291
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,127
We have a right to swing their backs and as we stand on the crossroads of History

292
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
We can make the right choices

293
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
And meet the challenges that face us

294
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
America tonight if you feel the same energy that I do if you feel the same urgency that I

295
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
If you feel the same passion that I do if you feel the same hopefulness that I do if we do what

296
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
We must through that I have no doubt

297
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,679
But all across the country from Florida to Oregon from

298
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Terry will be sworn in as

299
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
The president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice-president

300
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
And this country will reclaim its promise

301
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
And all of this long political Darkness

302
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
A Brighter Day Will Come

303
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Thank you very much everybody God bless you
